The `get_next_line` project is a classic exercise in C, which is part of the 42 Network curriculum. The goal is to create a function `get_next_line` that reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it, handling multiple reads if the line is longer than the buffer size. You need to pay attention to memory management, edge cases, and performance, all of which make this a great test of your C skills.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you implement `get_next_line` with all necessary protections and considerations from the 101 level.

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements

The function `get_next_line` needs to:
- Read from a file descriptor (FD) and return one line at a time.
- Handle multiple calls (you should be able to call it multiple times and get subsequent lines).
- Handle different cases like empty lines, end of file (EOF), and errors.
- Properly manage memory and avoid leaks.
- Deal with line breaks, including different platforms' line-ending characters (e.g., `\n` for UNIX, `\r\n` for Windows).

The function prototype is:
```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```

### Step 2: Create the Helper Function

We'll start by creating a helper function to handle the buffer reading and storing logic. This function will:
- Read from the file descriptor into a static buffer.
- Process the buffer to find and return lines.

### Step 3: Declare the Static Variables

You'll need a static variable to keep track of the file descriptor and the data that hasn't been returned yet. This is because you need to "remember" what you already read across multiple function calls.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 42

static char *read_until_newline(int fd, char **remainder) {
    char buf[BUFFER_SIZE + 1];
    ssize_t bytes_read;
    char *line = NULL;
    size_t line_len = 0;

    while ((bytes_read = read(fd, buf, BUFFER_SIZE)) > 0) {
        buf[bytes_read] = '\0';
        
        // Check if we found a newline in the buffer
        char *newline_pos = ft_strchr(buf, '\n');
        
        // If there's a newline, split the buffer and save the rest
        if (newline_pos) {
            *newline_pos = '\0';
            *remainder = ft_strdup(newline_pos + 1);
        }
        
        // Append the buffer to the line
        line = ft_strjoin(line, buf);
        
        if (*remainder) {
            break;
        }
    }
    return line;
}
```

### Step 4: Implement `get_next_line`

```c
char *get_next_line(int fd) {
    static char *remainder;
    char *line;

    if (fd < 0 || BUFFER_SIZE <= 0) {
        return NULL;
    }

    // If there's a remainder (leftover data from the previous read), return it.
    if (remainder) {
        line = ft_strdup(remainder);
        free(remainder);
        remainder = NULL;
    } else {
        line = read_until_newline(fd, &remainder);
    }

    return line;
}
```

### Step 5: Implement Helper Functions

#### `ft_strchr`

You need a helper function `ft_strchr` that searches for a character in a string. This is needed for detecting the newline character in the buffer.

```c
char *ft_strchr(const char *s, int c) {
    while (*s) {
        if (*s == c) {
            return (char *)s;
        }
        s++;
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

#### `ft_strjoin`

The `ft_strjoin` function combines two strings into one, which is crucial when concatenating the contents of the buffer to the output line.

```c
char *ft_strjoin(char *s1, char *s2) {
    size_t len1 = 0;
    size_t len2 = 0;
    char *result;

    // Find the length of both strings
    while (s1 && s1[len1]) {
        len1++;
    }
    while (s2 && s2[len2]) {
        len2++;
    }

    // Allocate memory for the new string
    result = malloc(len1 + len2 + 1);
    if (!result) {
        return NULL;
    }

    // Copy the strings into the new result
    size_t i = 0;
    for (; i < len1; i++) {
        result[i] = s1[i];
    }
    for (size_t j = 0; j < len2; j++) {
        result[i + j] = s2[j];
    }

    result[i + len2] = '\0';
    return result;
}
```

#### `ft_strdup`

This function duplicates a string, which is useful for copying the remainder after finding a newline.

```c
char *ft_strdup(const char *s) {
    size_t len = 0;
    while (s[len]) {
        len++;
    }
    
    char *dup = malloc(len + 1);
    if (!dup) {
        return NULL;
    }
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        dup[i] = s[i];
    }
    dup[len] = '\0';
    
    return dup;
}
```

### Step 6: Error Handling and Edge Cases

- **EOF**: When `read` returns 0, you've reached the end of the file. You should return `NULL` or an empty string if no further lines are available.
- **Error Handling**: If `read` returns -1, it indicates an error. You should return `NULL` and possibly set an error flag or log the issue.
- **Memory Management**: Ensure that you free any allocated memory where necessary, particularly the static remainder buffer.

### Step 7: Testing

You should test your function against various cases:
1. Reading a file line by line.
2. Reading from a file that doesn’t contain newlines.
3. Handling large files and buffers larger than the line size.
4. Handling multiple file descriptors.
5. Handling edge cases like empty lines or files.

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;
    
    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", line);
        free(line);
    }
    
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

### Final Thoughts

- Make sure to handle edge cases, such as files that have no newline, files with multiple newlines, and empty lines.
- Pay attention to the buffer size and ensure that you allocate memory correctly.
- Always free any allocated memory when you’re done with it.

By following these steps and implementing the necessary functions, you'll be able to create a robust version of `get_next_line` that passes all 42 project tests and handles all the edge cases effectively.
