# Get Next Line - 42 Network Project

Get Next Line is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, designed to efficiently handle large lines and multiple file descriptors, while ensuring proper memory management without relying on external libraries.
It helps in handling file input in C and is a key part of the 42 Network curriculum.
